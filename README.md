# duplicate-question-pairing-for-quora
Over 100 million people visit Quora each month, so it's no wonder that many users ask questions with similar wording. Duplicate questions with the same purpose can make it harder for users to find the best answers and may lead contributors to respond to multiple versions of the same query. Quora prioritizes canonical questions as they improve the experience for both seekers and contributors, offering greater value to both groups over time.

To address this issue, I have created and tested a model using Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, combined with a Bag of Words-based NLP approach. This machine learning solution efficiently identifies and consolidates duplicate questions, enhancing the overall user experience.
